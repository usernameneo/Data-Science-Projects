The Dirty Cafe Sales dataset contains 10,000 rows of synthetic data representing sales transactions in a cafe. This dataset is intentionally "dirty," with missing values, inconsistent data, and errors introduced to provide a realistic scenario for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). It can be used to practice cleaning techniques, data wrangling, and feature engineering.
