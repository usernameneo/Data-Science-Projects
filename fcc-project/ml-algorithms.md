# ML Algorithms

Machine learning algorithms are statistical models that enable computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. These algorithms are designed to improve their performance on a task over time, using experience and data to refine their predictions and decisions. We will be looking into the **K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Neural Netowrks, Linear Regression, K-Means Clustering and Principal Componenent Analysis algorithms**.
